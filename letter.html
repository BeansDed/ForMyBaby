        <p class="letter-greeting">My Dearest Baby,</p>
        
        <p>As I sit here thinking about you, my heart overflows with so much love that I can barely contain it. You are the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me, and I want you to know just how deeply you've touched my soul.</p>
        
        <p>From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. The world became brighter, colors more vivid, and every day filled with new possibilities. You brought magic into my ordinary days and turned my dreams into reality.</p>
        
        <p>I love the way you see the world with such wonder and kindness. Your compassion for others, your gentle spirit, and your incredible strength inspire me every single day. You make me want to be the best version of myself, not because you ask me to, but because your love makes me believe I can be.</p>
        
        <p>Every moment we share together is a treasure I hold close to my heart. Whether we're laughing until we cry, having deep conversations under the stars, or simply enjoying comfortable silence together, each memory we create is precious beyond measure.</p>
        
        <p>You are my safe haven, my greatest adventure, my home. In your arms, I've found peace. In your eyes, I've found my future. In your heart, I've found my forever.</p>
        
        <p>I promise to love you through every season of life, to support your dreams, to celebrate your victories, and to hold you close during challenges. I promise to choose you every day, to grow with you, and to never stop showing you how much you mean to me.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for making my life infinitely more beautiful just by being in it.</p>
        
        <p class="letter-closing">Forever and always yours,<br>
